4. Click **Tags** or **Categories**.
5. Click **Settings** at the top right.

Once enabled, the **tag and/or category field will be marked as required** on all expenses.

{% include info.html %}
Even if tags and/or categories are set as required, expenses can still be submitted without them. However, the submitter and approver will see an **orange dot** on the expense details, indicating that a tag/category is missing.
{% include end-info.html %}
